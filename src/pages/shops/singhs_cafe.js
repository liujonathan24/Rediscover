For decades, Punjabi cuisine has been strongly influenced by Mughal invaders, who brought with them the tradition of the great kebabs and shahi foods. This now-transformed Punjabi-style cooking is celebrated as one of the most popular cuisines throughout the world. A strong advocate of staff development within the industry and promoting the highest standards of food, cooking, and service, our head chef, Mr. Harpreet Singh is a member of the Academy of Culinary Arts as well as a Master Chef of Indian Cuisine.

 

Mr. Singh is a third generation chef and combines traditional, authentic recipes with a very special and exotic blend of his own delightful and mouth-watering entrees. An amazing combination of North-Indian Punjabi flavors, Lucknow, and Hyderbadi cuisine intermixed with the rarest of South-Indian flavors. Every ingredient used is fresh.

 

Here at the Singhâ€™s Cafe, all members are devoted in maintaining consistency and diversity. Mr. Singh and his team want to share their passion and love for food with everyone.

We give our No. 1 priority to our customer, so please share with us your experiences, any concern(s), or any questions and we will oblige to serve you the best.
